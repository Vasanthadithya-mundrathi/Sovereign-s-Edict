# Security Guide for Sovereign's Edict

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in Sovereign's Edict and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure development environment.

## Environment Variables and Secrets Management

### Current Status
- The `.env` file containing sensitive information (like API keys) has been removed from Git tracking
- A `.gitignore` file has been added to prevent future accidental commits of sensitive files
- The project now uses the `.env.example` file as a template for developers

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit sensitive information**:
   - API keys
   - Database passwords
   - Private keys
   - Personal credentials

2. **Use environment variables**:
   - Store sensitive data in environment variables
   - Use `.env` files for local development only
   - Always add `.env` files to `.gitignore`

3. **Rotate credentials regularly**:
   - Change API keys periodically
   - Revoke compromised keys immediately
   - Use service accounts with minimal required permissions

## Data Security Policy

### Personal Data Handling
- The system must not store raw personal data
- All arguments should be displayed in aggregate without personally identifying information
- Implement data anonymization techniques for any user input

### Data Encryption
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Set appropriate limits for different user tiers

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Dependency Management

### Regular Updates
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `npm audit` and `safety` for Python dependencies

### Trusted Sources
- Only use dependencies from trusted sources
- Review dependency licenses
- Minimize the number of external dependencies

## Access Control

### Repository Access
- Limit repository access to authorized team members
- Use branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews for code changes

### Deployment Security
- Use secure deployment pipelines
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Protect production environments with additional security measures

## Incident Response

### Compromised Credentials
If you suspect that credentials have been compromised:

1. Immediately revoke the affected credentials
2. Generate new credentials
3. Update all relevant configuration files
4. Monitor for unauthorized access
5. Document the incident and lessons learned

### Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. Report it immediately to the project maintainers
2. Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability
3. Work with the team to develop and deploy a fix
4. Coordinate public disclosure after the fix is deployed

## Compliance

### Data Protection Regulations
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement privacy by design principles
- Provide users with control over their data

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Protect logs from unauthorized access
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activity

### Security Audits
- Conduct regular security audits
- Engage third-party security experts when possible
- Address identified vulnerabilities promptly

## Training and Awareness

### Team Education
- Provide regular security training for all team members
- Stay updated on the latest security threats and best practices
- Foster a culture of security awareness
