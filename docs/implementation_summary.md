# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

### Plugin Development
```python
# Example plugin structure
from modules.base import IngestorModule

class CustomIngestor(IngestorModule):
    def initialize(self): 
        return True
    
    def can_handle(self, source_type): 
        return source_type == "custom"
    
    def ingest(self, source): 
        return [{"text": "Custom data"}]

# Register the plugin
from modules import module_registry
module_registry.register_ingestor("custom", CustomIngestor())
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is properly handled according to data protection regulations
- Environment variables are managed through `.env` files that are excluded from version control
- Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities
- Dependencies are regularly updated to patch known security issues
- Data processing can be performed entirely client-side for maximum privacy
