## Security Measures

### API Keys and Secrets

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure
- Always use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables

### Data Protection

- No raw personal data is stored in the system
- All data processing is done in aggregate form
- Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS
- Access to the system is protected by authentication

### Dependency Management

- Dependencies are regularly updated to patch known security issues
- Security audits are conducted periodically
- Only trusted, well-maintained dependencies are used

### Access Control

- Production systems are protected by authentication
- Role-based access control is implemented where appropriate
- Regular access reviews are conducted

## Best Practices

### For Developers

- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all system access
- Keep all dependencies up to date

### For Users

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Report any suspicious activity immediately

## Security Audits

Regular security audits are conducted to ensure the continued security of the platform. These audits include:

- Code reviews for security vulnerabilities
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Penetration testing
- Compliance verification

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. The incident is immediately contained
2. Affected systems are isolated
3. An investigation is conducted to determine the scope and impact
4. Users are notified if their data may have been compromised
